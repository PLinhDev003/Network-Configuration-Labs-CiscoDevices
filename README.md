# Network-Configuration-Labs-CiscoDevices

This repository contains practice labs for configuring Cisco network devices using Packet Tracer. The exercises cover fundamental networking concepts, VLANs, routing protocols, NAT, ACLs, and more.

## Lab List

### Lab 01: Basic Configuration on Cisco Router and Switch
- Connect devices using appropriate cables.
- Assign IP addresses to PCs and network interfaces.
- Configure CLI modes, hostname, and passwords.
- Encrypt passwords and save configurations.
- Backup and restore configuration files using TFTP.
- Perform password and IOS recovery.

### Lab 02: VLAN, Trunking, VTP, and STP
- Configure VLANs and assign ports to VLANs.
- Set up Trunk links using IEEE 802.1Q.
- Implement VTP (VLAN Trunking Protocol) for VLAN management.
- Configure STP (Spanning Tree Protocol) to prevent network loops.
- Enable Inter-VLAN routing for communication between VLANs.
- Implement a DHCP Server and Relay Agent.

### Lab 03: RIP, OSPF, NAT, and ACL
- Configure RIP and OSPF routing protocols for network convergence.
- Implement NAT (Network Address Translation) for internet access.
- Set up ACLs (Access Control Lists) for traffic filtering and security.
- Configure PAT (Port Address Translation) for load balancing.
- Fine-tune OSPF settings, including Router-ID, DR/BDR selection, and cost metrics.

## Requirements
- Cisco Packet Tracer or real Cisco devices.
- Basic knowledge of networking and Cisco IOS commands.
- A system capable of running Packet Tracer simulations.
